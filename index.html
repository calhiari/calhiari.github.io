    <h1>PIC Microcontrollers.</h1>
    <h2>A really basic overview.</h2>
    <img src="images/PIC18F8720.jpg" alt="A PIC18F8720 Microchip microcontroller.">
    <p>PIC Microcontrollers are programmable devices that can control electronic circuits, with imput and output signals.</p>
    <p>They are often confused as microprocessors, and in fact they have a built-in microprocessor, but they also have</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RAM memory</li>
        <li>EEPROM memory</li>
        <li>registers for A/D conversion</li>
        <li>registers for PWM signal</li>
        <li>registers for serial communication</li>        
    </ul>
    <p>and a lot more useful features as a control device.</p>
    <p>It processing power is very below our usual personal computers, with just a few millions instructions per second, but if you put the right code on it, you can control everything you want to.</p>
